     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Data Structures (CSC305) and Data Structures Lab (CSL303) are core subjects in the Second Year (Semester III) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses establish the foundational understanding of organizing and managing data efficiently, which is crucial for developing high-performance algorithms and robust software systems.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in data structure theory and application:

- **Introduction to Data Structures**: Concept of ADT, types of data structures (linear and non-linear), and algorithm complexity analysis.
- **Arrays**: Representation, operations (insertion, deletion, traversal), and multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular lists, and their applications.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementation using arrays and linked lists, applications like expression parsing (infix/postfix), and priority queues.
- **Searching and Sorting**: Linear search, binary search, and various sorting algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Quick, Merge, Shell).
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and tree traversal techniques.
- **Graphs**: Representation (adjacency matrix/list), traversal (BFS, DFS), and shortest path algorithms.
- **Hashing**: Hash functions, collision resolution techniques, and applications.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, question papers, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that data structure fundamentals remain essential for software engineering, system design, and technical interviews. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental data structure concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through DS and DS Lab.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.

## Data Structures Laboratory

The laboratory component (CSL303) focuses on hands-on implementation of various data structures and algorithms using C, providing practical experience in solving complex computational problems.

> [!TIP]
> **Visualization is Key**: Always draw the state of your data structure (nodes, pointers, indices) on paper before and during code implementation. Dry running your logic with small test cases is the most effective way to debug complex pointer manipulations.
